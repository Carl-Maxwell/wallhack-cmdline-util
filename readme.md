## Wallhack

This project is a command line utility to help with using my [rails-lite](https://github.com/modred11/rails-lite) project.

To use it, just put the file `wallhack` into a folder that's in your PATH and
then you'll be able to use wallhack like so:

```bash
cd rails-lite
wallhack console
```
